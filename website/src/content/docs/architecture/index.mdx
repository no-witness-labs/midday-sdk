description: Documentation of key architectural decisions in Midday SDK
---

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document the key design choices made during the development of Midday SDK. These records explain the context, decision, and consequences of each architectural choice.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help:

- **New contributors** understand why the codebase is structured the way it is
- **Maintainers** remember the reasoning behind past decisions
- **Users** understand the design philosophy of the SDK

## Decision Records

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [ADR-001](/midday-sdk/architecture/adr-001-dual-api-pattern/) | Dual API Pattern (Promise + Effect) | Accepted |
| [ADR-002](/midday-sdk/architecture/adr-002-module-function-design/) | Module-Function Design | Accepted |
| [ADR-003](/midday-sdk/architecture/adr-003-effect-framework/) | Effect as Core Runtime | Accepted |
| [ADR-004](/midday-sdk/architecture/adr-004-tagged-errors/) | Tagged Error Handling | Accepted |

## ADR Template

When proposing a new ADR, use the following structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that motivates this decision?

## Decision

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result of this decision?
```

## Contributing

To propose a new architectural decision:

1. Create a new ADR file following the template
2. Submit a pull request with the proposed decision
3. Discuss in the PR until consensus is reached
4. Update status to "Accepted" when merged
