import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- A package manager (pnpm, npm, or yarn)

## Install the Package

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @no-witness-labs/midday-sdk
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @no-witness-labs/midday-sdk
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn" icon="seti:yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @no-witness-labs/midday-sdk
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Peer Dependencies

Midday SDK includes all necessary dependencies. However, if you're using the Effect API, you may want to install Effect explicitly for better IDE support:

```bash
pnpm add effect
```

## TypeScript Configuration

Midday SDK is written in TypeScript and ships with type definitions. For the best experience, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## Browser vs Node.js

Midday SDK works in both environments, but there are some differences:

| Feature | Node.js | Browser |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Wallet | Seed-based HD wallet | Lace wallet extension |
| Private State | In-memory or file-based | IndexedDB |
| ZK Config | Local or HTTP provider | HTTP provider |

## Next Steps

Now that you have Midday SDK installed, head to the [Quick Start](/midday-sdk/getting-started/quick-start/) guide to create your first client.
