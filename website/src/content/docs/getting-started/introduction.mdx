**Midday SDK** is a developer-friendly SDK for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the [Midnight Network](https://midnight.network/).

## What is Midnight Network?

Midnight is a data-protection blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving smart contracts. It allows developers to build applications where sensitive data remains private while still being verifiable on-chain.

## Why Midday SDK?

The official Midnight JavaScript libraries are powerful but can be complex to work with. Midday SDK provides:

- **Simplified API** - High-level abstractions that reduce boilerplate
- **Multiple Programming Styles** - Choose between Promise API, Effect API, or Effect with Dependency Injection
- **Browser Support** - First-class support for browser environments with Lace wallet integration
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Effect Integration** - Built on [Effect](https://effect.website/) for robust error handling and composability

## API Styles

Midday SDK offers three ways to interact with contracts:

### Promise API
The simplest approach, ideal for quick prototypes or developers unfamiliar with Effect:

```typescript
const contract = await Midday.ContractBuilder.deploy(builder);
await Midday.Contract.call(contract, 'increment');
```

### Effect API
For developers who want functional programming benefits without dependency injection:

```typescript
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const contract = yield* Midday.ContractBuilder.effect.deploy(builder);
  return yield* Midday.Contract.effect.call(contract, 'increment');
});
```

### Effect with Dependency Injection
For large applications that benefit from testability and modularity:

```typescript
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const contractService = yield* Midday.ContractService;
  return yield* contractService.call(contract, 'increment');
});
```
