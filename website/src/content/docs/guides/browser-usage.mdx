description: Using Midday SDK in browser environments with Lace wallet
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Midday SDK supports browser environments with integration for the [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/) extension.

## Prerequisites

- Lace wallet browser extension installed
- Lace wallet connected to Midnight testnet

## Connecting to Lace Wallet

<Steps>

1. **Connect to the wallet**

   ```typescript
   import * as Midday from '@no-witness-labs/midday-sdk';

   const wallet = await Midday.Wallet.fromBrowser('preview');
   ```

   This will prompt the user to approve the connection in their Lace wallet.

2. **Create a client from the connection**

   ```typescript
   const client = await Midday.Client.create({
     wallet,
     privateStateProvider: Midday.PrivateState.indexedDBPrivateStateProvider({
       privateStateStoreName: 'my-app'
     }),
   });
   ```

3. **Load and deploy a contract**

   ```typescript
   const loaded = await client.loadContract({
     module: CounterContract,
     zkConfig: new Midday.ZkConfig.HttpZkConfigProvider('https://cdn.example.com/zk'),
     privateStateId: 'my-counter',
   });
   const deployed = await loaded.deploy();
   await deployed.actions.increment();
   ```

</Steps>

## Complete Example

```typescript
import * as Midday from '@no-witness-labs/midday-sdk';
import * as CounterContract from './contracts/counter/contract/index.js';

async function main() {
  // Connect to Lace wallet
  const wallet = await Midday.Wallet.fromBrowser('preview');

  // Create client with connected wallet
  const client = await Midday.Client.create({
    wallet,
    privateStateProvider: Midday.PrivateState.indexedDBPrivateStateProvider({
      privateStateStoreName: 'my-app'
    }),
  });

  // Load contract with zkConfig
  const loaded = await client.loadContract({
    module: CounterContract,
    zkConfig: new Midday.ZkConfig.HttpZkConfigProvider('/zk-config'),
    privateStateId: 'my-counter',
  });

  // Deploy and interact
  const deployed = await loaded.deploy();
  await deployed.actions.increment();

  // Read state
  const state = await deployed.ledgerState();
  console.log('Counter:', state.counter);
}
```

## Fee Relay (Optional)

For apps where users don't need to hold dust tokens, enable fee relay:

```typescript
const client = await Midday.Client.create({
  wallet,
  privateStateProvider: Midday.PrivateState.indexedDBPrivateStateProvider({
    privateStateStoreName: 'my-app',
  }),
  feeRelay: { url: 'http://localhost:3002' },
});
```

## Browser-Specific Considerations

### Private State Storage

In browsers, use IndexedDB for persistent private state:

```typescript
const privateStateProvider = Midday.PrivateState.indexedDBPrivateStateProvider({
  privateStateStoreName: 'my-app-private-state',
});
```

:::tip
Use a unique store name per application to avoid conflicts.
:::

### ZK Configuration

In browser environments, use `HttpZkConfigProvider` to load zk artifacts from a URL:

```typescript
const loaded = await client.loadContract({
  module: CounterContract,
  zkConfig: new Midday.ZkConfig.HttpZkConfigProvider('https://cdn.example.com/zk'),
  privateStateId: 'my-counter',
});
```

:::note
Ensure your ZK config server has proper CORS headers configured. The server should serve the contract's keys and zkir directories.
:::

### Network Selection

Match the network to the wallet's current network:

```typescript
// Connect to preview network
const wallet = await Midday.Wallet.fromBrowser('preview');

// Or connect to mainnet (when available)
const wallet = await Midday.Wallet.fromBrowser('mainnet');
```

## Wallet Connection Details

The wallet connection provides keys and configuration:

```typescript
const wallet = await Midday.Wallet.fromBrowser('preview');

// Access wallet info
console.log('Address:', wallet.address);

// Get balance
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();
console.log('Balance:', balance);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Found

If `fromBrowser` throws an error, ensure:

1. Lace wallet extension is installed
2. The wallet is unlocked
3. The user has allowed the site to connect

### Transaction Signing

All transactions are signed by the Lace wallet. The user will see a confirmation dialog for each transaction.

### CORS Issues

If ZK configs fail to load, check that your ZK config server includes:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Or configure it to allow your specific domain.
