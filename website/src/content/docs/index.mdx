## Quick Example

```typescript
import * as Midday from '@no-witness-labs/midday-sdk';
import * as CounterContract from './contracts/counter/contract/index.js';

// Create client (no zkConfig at client level)
const client = await Midday.Client.create({
  networkConfig: Midday.Config.NETWORKS.preview,
  seed: 'your-64-char-hex-seed',
  privateStateProvider: Midday.PrivateState.inMemoryPrivateStateProvider(),
});

// Load contract (zkConfig loaded per-contract)
const loaded = await client.loadContract({
  module: CounterContract,
  zkConfig: Midday.ZkConfig.fromPath('./contracts/counter'),
  privateStateId: 'my-counter',
});

// Deploy and interact
const deployed = await loaded.deploy();
await deployed.actions.increment();
const state = await deployed.ledgerState();
```
