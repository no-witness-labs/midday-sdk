## Quick Example

```typescript
import * as Midday from '@no-witness-labs/midday-sdk';

// Create client
const client = await Midday.Client.create({
  networkConfig: Midday.Config.NETWORKS.testnet,
  seed: 'your-64-char-hex-seed',
  zkConfigProvider: new Midday.HttpZkConfigProvider('https://cdn.example.com/zk'),
  privateStateProvider: Midday.inMemoryPrivateStateProvider(),
});

// Deploy and interact with contracts
const builder = await Midday.Client.contractFrom(client, {
  module: await import('./contracts/counter/index.js'),
});
const contract = await Midday.ContractBuilder.deploy(builder);
await Midday.Contract.call(contract, 'increment');
```
