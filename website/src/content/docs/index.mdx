## Quick Example

```typescript
import {
  Client,
  Contract,
  ContractBuilder,
  Config,
  Providers,
} from '@no-witness-labs/midday-sdk';

// Create client
const client = await Client.create({
  networkConfig: Config.NETWORKS.testnet,
  seed: 'your-64-char-hex-seed',
  zkConfigProvider: new Providers.HttpZkConfigProvider('https://cdn.example.com/zk'),
  privateStateProvider: Providers.inMemoryPrivateStateProvider(),
});

// Deploy and interact with contracts
const builder = await Client.contractFrom(client, {
  module: await import('./contracts/counter/index.js'),
});
const contract = await ContractBuilder.deploy(builder);
await Contract.call(contract, 'increment');
```
